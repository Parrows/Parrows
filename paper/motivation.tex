\section{Motivation}
Arrows were introduced in John Hughes paper as a general interface for computation and therefore as an alternative to monads for API design \citHughes. In the paper Hughes describes how arrows are a generalization of monads and how they are not as restrictive. In this paper we will use this concept to express parallelism.
