%\section{Motivation}
%Arrows were introduced in John Hughes paper as a general interface for computation and therefore as an alternative to Monads for API design \citHughes. In the paper Hughes describes how arrows are a generalization of Monads and how they are not as restrictive. In this paper we will use this concept to express parallelism.

Pure functional programming languages have been used
since longer time as a ``sand box'' for testing novel parallel
programming approaches. Reasons for this include referential
transparency and the ease of introducing new sophisticated language
concepts. Specially for Haskell (on which this paper focuses), various
approaches reached maturity. The definite parallel Haskell does not
exist, there are multiple parallel Haskells. We regard here in-depth
the Multicore Haskell (a SMP implementation of GpH language), the
|Par| Monad, and Eden, a distributed memory parallel Haskell. These
languages represent orthogonal approaches. Some use a monad, even if
only for the internal representation. Some introduce additional
language constructs. 
%In this paper we introduce a notion of parallel
%computations using Arrows.
We use here Arrows to represent parallel computations. This has not
been done before.

%Our Arrows-based interface is a high-level one.
We provide an Arrows-based typeclass and various implementations.
Instead of 
introducing a new low-level parallel backend in order to implement our
Arrows-based interface, we define a shallow-embedded DSL for Arrows. This DSL
is defined as a common interface and varying implementations in
existing parallel Haskells: Multicore Haskell, |Par| Monad, and
Eden. Thus, we not only define a parallel programming interface in a
novel manner. We tame the zoo of parallel Haskells. We provide a
common, very low-penalty programming interface that allows to switch
the parallel Haskell backends at will. Further backends are viable, too.

\mbcomment{different, how?}
We wrap parallel Haskells inside of our |ArrowParallel| interface, but
% why do we aim to abstract parallelism this way and what does this
% approach do better than the other parallel Haskells?
 is such a parallelism abstraction of benefit and to what extent does
 it improve existing approaches?
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Arrow DSL benefits}:
	With the |ArrowParallel| typeclass we do not lose any benefits of using arrows as |parEvalN| is a yet another Arrow combinator. The resulting Arrow can be used in the same way a potential serial version could be used. This is a big advantage of this approach, especially compared to the Monad solutions as we do not introduce any new types. We can just \enquote{plug} in parallel parts into sequential Arrow-based programs without having to change anything.
	\item \textbf{Abstraction}:
	With the |ArrowParallel| typeclass, we abstract all parallel implementation logic away from the business logic. This leaves us in the beautiful situation of being able to write our code against the interface of the typeclass without being bound to any parallel Haskell. So as an example, during development, we can run the program in a simple GHC-compiled variant and afterwards deploy it on a cluster by converting it into an Eden version, by just replacing the current |ArrowParallel| instance.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Structure}
The remaining text is structures as follows. Section~\ref{sec:background} briefly introduces known parallel Haskell flavours (Sec.~\ref{sec:parEvalNIntro}) and gives an overview of Arrows to the reader (Sec.~\ref{sec:arrows}). Section~\ref{sec:related-work} discusses related work. Section~\ref{sec:parallel-arrows} defines Parallel Arrows and presents a basic interface. Section~\ref{futures} defines Futures for Parallel Arrows, this concept enables better communication. Section~\ref{sec:map-skeletons} presents some basic algorithmic skeletons  in our newly defined dialect: parallel |map| with and without load balancing. More advanced skeletons are showcased in Section~\ref{sec:topology-skeletons} (|pipe|, |ring|, |torus|). Section~\ref{sec:benchmarks} shows the benchmark results. Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} discusses future work and concludes.
