	we are able to reproduce thin features of the extracted surface without
	excessive sub-division required by methods such as Marching Cubes
	or Dual Contouring. Dual Marching Cubes produces a crack-free, adaptive
	polygonalization of the surface that reproduces sharp features. Our
	approach maintains the advantage of using structured grids for operations
	such as CSG while being able to conform to the relevant features
	of the implicit function yielding much sparser polygonalizations
	than has been possible using structured grids.},

The method combines streaming and parallelization, moving least-squares (MLS) projection, adaptive space subdivision, and regularized isosurface extraction. Besides presenting the overall design and evaluation of the system, our contributions include methods for keeping in-core data structures complexity purely locally output-sensitive and for exploiting both the explicit and implicit data produced by a MLS projector to produce tightly fitting regularized triangulations using a primal isosurface extractor. Our results show that the system is fast, scalable, and accurate. We are able to process models with several hundred million points in about an hour and outperform current fast streaming reconstructors in terms of geometric accuracy. },

abstract ={The precise arrangement of B- and T-lymphocytes in the different compartments of the human splenic white pulp is still largely unknown. We therefore performed a 3D reconstruction of 150 serial sections of a representative adult human spleen alternately stained for CD3 and CD20. The results indicate that the T-cell regions of human spleens may be interrupted by B-cell follicles. Therefore, there is no continuous periarteriolar lymphatic T-cell sheath (PALS) around white pulp arterioles. An arteriole may be surrounded by T-lymphocytes at one level, then run across a follicle without any T-cells around, and finally re-enter a T-cell region. T- and B-cell compartments are intricately interdigitated in the human splenic white pulp. CD4+ T-lymphocytes and the typical fibroblasts of the T-cell region may extend as a thin shell at the follicular surface within the marginal zone. On the other hand, IgD++ B-cells continue from the follicular outer marginal zone along the surface of the T-cell region. Our findings indicate that the microanatomy of the splenic white pulp differs between humans and rodents. This may have consequences for the immigration of recirculating lymphocytes and for initial interactions among antigen-specific T- and B-lymphocytes.},

There is, consequently, widespread interest in accurately relating information in the different images for diagnosis, treatment and basic science. This article reviews registration techniques used to solve this problem, and describes the wide variety of applications to which these techniques are applied. Applications of image registration include combining images of the same subject from different modalities, aligning temporal sequences of images to compensate for motion of the subject between scans, image guidance during interventions and aligning images from multiple subjects in cohort studies. Current registration algorithms can, in many cases, automatically register images that are related by a rigid body transformation (i.e. where tissue deformation can be ignored). There has also been substantial progress in non-rigid registration algorithms that can compensate for tissue deformation, or align images from different subjects. Nevertheless many registration problems remain unsolved, and this is likely to continue to be an active field of research in the future.}

abstract = {Image registration plays an increasingly important role in the field of medical image processing given the plurality
of images often acquired from different sensors, time points, or viewpoints. Landmark-based registration schemes
represent the most popular class of registration methods due to their simplicity and high accuracy. Previous
studies have shown that these registration schemes are sensitive to the number and location of landmarks.
Identifying important landmarks to perform an accurate registration remains a very challenging task. Current
landmark selection methods, such as feature-based approaches, focus on optimization of global transformation
and may have poor performance in recovering local deformation, e.g. subtle tissue changes caused by tumor
resection, making them inappropriate for registering pre- and post-surgery images as a small cancerous region
will be deformed after removing a tumor. In this work, a novel method is introduced to estimate optimal landmark
configurations. An important landmark configuration that will be used as a training landmark set was learned
for an image pair with a known deformation. This landmark configuration can be considered as a collection
of discrete points. A generic transformation matrix between a pair of training landmark sets with different
deformation locations was computed via an iterative close point (ICP) alignment technique. A new landmark
configuration was determined by simply transforming the training landmarks to the current displacement location
while preserving the topological structure of the configuration of landmarks. Two assumptions are made: 1) In
a new pair of images the deformation is approximately the same size and has only been spatially relocated in the
image, and that by a simple affine transformation one can identify the optimal configuration on this new pair of
images; and 2) The deformation is of similar size and shape on the original pair of images. These are reasonable
assumptions in many cases where one seeks to register tumor images at multiple time points following application
of therapy and to evaluate changes in tumor size. The experiments were conducted on 286 pairs of synthetic
MRI brain images. The training landmark configurations were obtained through 2000 iterations of registration
where the points with consistently best registration performance were selected. The estimated landmarks greatly
improved the quality metrics compared to a uniform grid placement scheme and a speeded-up robust features
(SURF) based method as well as a generic free-form deformation (FFD) approach. The quantitative results
showed that the new landmark configuration achieved 95\% improvement in recovering the local deformation
compared to 89\% for the uniform grid placement, 79\% for the SURF-based approach, and 10\% for the generic
FFD approach.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose three novel and important methods for the registration of histological images for 3D reconstruction. First, possible intensity variations and nonstandardness in images are corrected by an intensity standardization process which maps the image scale into a standard scale where the similar intensities correspond to similar tissues meaning. Second, 2D histological images are mapped into a feature space where continuous variables are used as high confidence image features for accurate registration. Third, we propose an automatic best reference slice selection algorithm that improves reconstruction quality based on both image entropy and mean square error of the registration process. We demonstrate that the choice of reference slice has a significant impact on registration error, standardization, feature space and entropy information. After 2D histological slices are registered through an affine transformation with respect to an automatically chosen reference, the 3D volume is reconstructed by co-registering 2D slices elastically.},

abstract = {We present a super-fast and parameter-free algorithm for non-rigid elastic registration of images of a serially sectioned whole rat brain. The purpose is to produce a three-dimensional high-resolution reconstruction. The registration is modelled as a minimization problem of a functional consisting of a distance measure and a regularizer based on the elastic potential of the displacement field. The minimization of the functional leads to a system of non-linear partial differential equations, the so-called Navier-Lame equations (NLE). Discretization of the NLE and a fixed point type iteration method lead to a linear system of equations, which has to be solved at each iteration step. We not only present a super-fast solution technique for this system, but also come up with sound strategies for accelerating the outer iteration. This does include a multi-scale approach based on a Gaussian pyramid as well as a clever estimation of the material constants for the elastic potential. The results of the registration process were controlled by an expert who was able to recognize histological details like laminations which was not possible before. Therefore, it is essential to apply elastic registration to this kind of imaging problem. Finally, the visually pleasing results were quantified by a distance measure leading to an improvement of about 79% after just 35 iteration steps.},

abstract = {In image registration of medical data a common and challenging problem is handling intensity-inhomogeneities. These  inhomogeneities appear for instance in images of serially sectioned brains caused by the histological staining process or in medical imaging with contrast agents. Beneath this, natural outliers (for instance cells or vessels) produced by the underlying material itself may be mistaken as noise. Both image registration applications have in common that the well known sum of squared differences (SSD) measure would detect false differences. To deal with these kinds of problems, we supplement the common SSD-measure with image derivatives of higher order. Additionally we introduce a non-quadratic penalizer function to the distance measure leading to robust energy. The concepts are well known in optical flow. Overall, we present a variational model which combines all of these properties. This formulation leads to a fast and efficient algorithm. We demonstrate its applicability at the problems described above.},

	over the Internet. For service-discovery, the supporting runtime-system
	(implemented itself in Haskell) can map symbolic names to the low-level
	references used for internal communication. A stream layer abstracts
	from the actual IO and allows to use some means of communication
	in a functional context. We present both our experiences from the
	implementation and sample applications, using many of the language
	features Haskell provides. Finally a detailed discussion of the implementation

	designs: Eden and GpH. Both languages use the non-strict functional
	language Haskell as a core expression language, both their implementations
	are based on the same host sequential implementation --- the high
	performance Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), and both implementations
	are available on the same distributed architecture --- the St Andrews
	Beowulf cluster. This allows an exceptionally pure comparison of
	the language design characteristics and their impact on parallel
	performance.
	
	The comparison is illustrated by two parallel benchmarks which expose
	differences in the communication, process creation, and work distribution
	mechanisms employed by Eden and GpH. Our results show that the explicit
	process model favoured by Eden gives good parallel performance for
	coarse-grained applications running on the Beowulf cluster. In comparison,
	the implicit process model used in GpH gives poorer absolute speedup
	for this class of application on this architecture. Further work
	is needed to verify the reasons for this difference in performance
	and to extend these results to other architectures."},

  abstract = {The parallel functional language Eden extends Haskell with expressions
	to define and instantiate process systems. These extensions allow
	also the easy definition of skeletons as higher-order functions.
	Parallel programming is possible in Eden at two levels: Recursive
	programming and higher-order programming. At the lower level, processes
	are explicitly created by using recursive definitions. In this way,
	skeletons can be defined. This is very unusual, as most skeleton-based
	languages use an imperative language to create new skeletons. At
	the higher level, available skeletons are used to create applications
	or to define new skeletons on top of the other ones. In this paper,
	we present five skeletons, most of them well-known, covering a wide

                  of polynomial ideals without relying on term
                  orders. The main ingredient is a homogeneous
                  reduction algorithm which orthogonalizes leading
                  terms instead of completely canceling them. This
                  allows for an extension of Buchberger's algorithm to
                  construct these H-bases algorithmically. In
                  addition, the close connection of this approach to
                  minimal degree interpolation, and in particular to
                  the least interpolation scheme due to de Boor and
                  Ron, is pointed out.},

The two collaborated closely during the 1650s on some original and unusual mathematics, but while Wallis acquired a lasting reputation, Brouncker's work is no longer well known. The two parts of this paper analyse the joint work of Wallis and Brouncker and attempt to separate their respective contributions and very different mathematical styles. The main subject of Part I is Brouncker's discovery of continued fractions. He gave few clues as to how he obtained his results and I offer a possible reconstruction of his work. His quadrature of the hyperbola and rectification of the semicubical parabola are also discussed. Brouncker emerges as a skilled and intuitive mathematician.},

                  widespread use of parallel processing by both
                  industry and software houses. The two key issues of
                  portability of code and of generality of parallel
                  architectures are discussed. An overview of useful
                  computational models and programming paradigms for
                  parallel machines is presented along with some
                  detailed case studies implemented on transputer
                  arrays. Valiant's results on optimally universal
                  parallel machines are reviewed along with the
                  prospects of building truly general-purpose parallel
                  computers. Some remarks on language and software
                  tool developments for parallel programming form the
                  conclusion to the paper.}

                  Strassen's algorithm for moderate n (starting with n
                  = 20). The Bini-Lotti result on the weak stability
                  of bilinear algorithms applies to these
                  algorithms. We present them in two equivalent
                  versions, bilinear and trilinear. We also apply one
                  of these algorithms over finite fields (or rings) of
                  constants. Surprisingly, this enables us to decrease
                  the bilinear complexity of n X n matrix
                  multiplication (for 20 <= n <= 10^20) below the
                  current record upper bound for the same computation
                  over the infinite fields of complex, real, or
                  rational numbers."

  abstract =	 {Locally weighted regression, or loess, is a way of
                  estimating a regression surface through a
                  multivariate smoothing procedure, fitting a function
                  of the independent variables locally and in a moving
                  fashion analogous to how a moving average is
                  computed for a time series. With local fitting we
                  can estimate a much wider class of regression
                  surfaces than with the usual classes of parametric
                  functions, such as polynomials. The goal of this
                  article is to show, through applications, how loess
                  can be used for three purposes: data exploration,
                  diagnostic checking of parametric models, and
                  providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along
                  the way, the following methodology is introduced:
                  (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an
                  extension of univariate locally weighted regression;
                  (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to
                  those used in the least-squares fitting of
                  parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods
                  that are useful tools for understanding loess
                  estimates and checking the assumptions on which the
                  estimation procedure is based; and (d) the M plot,
                  an adaptation of Mallow's C<sub>p</sub> procedure,
                  which provides a graphical portrayal of the
                  trade-off between variance and bias, and which can
                  be used to choose the amount of smoothing.},

                  computing and plotting smoothed points. Robust
                  locally weighted regression is a method for
                  smoothing a scatterplot, (x<sub>i</sub>,
                  y<sub>i</sub>), i = 1, â‹¯, n, in which the fitted
                  value at x<sub>k</sub> is the value of a polynomial
                  fit to the data using weighted least squares, where
                  the weight for (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) is
                  large if x<sub>i</sub> is close to x<sub>k</sub> and
                  small if it is not. A robust fitting procedure is
                  used that guards against deviant points distorting
                  the smoothed points. Visual, computational, and
                  statistical issues of robust locally weighted
                  regression are discussed. Several examples,
                  including data on lead intoxication, are used to
                  illustrate the methodology.},

	Annote = {A technique for embedding human undecalcified tooth specimens in Technovit{\textregistered}9100 was developed, which permits immunohistological evaluation of pulp tissue in serial ground sections. Human molars were divided into 14-18 sections of about 23 µm thickness. Immunohistological double staining for S-100 and CD34 revealed unique associations of myelinated nerve fibre bundles with arterioles, which continued through the entire tooth pulp. These arterioles were not only accompanied by, but partially or totally enveloped in longitudinally orientated myelinated nerve fibre bundles. We speculate that this unique arrangement may mechanically support the arterioles and alleviate detection or regulation of their contraction state by sensory nerve cells.},

A control lattice with a coarse grid spacing is used first to account for slowly changing deformations. Next, a control lattice with a finer grid spacing is used to account for more localized and quickly changing deformations. We demonstrate this method on a sequence of images acquired from the lung of a living rat.},

abstract = "A hierarchical approach to elastic registration based on mutual information, in which the images are progressively subdivided, locally registered, and elastically interpolated, is presented. To improve the registration, a combination of prior and floating information on the joint probability is proposed. It is shown that such a combination increases the registration speed at the coarser levels in hierarchy, enables a registration of finer details, and provides additional guidance to the optimisation process. Besides, a threefold local registration consistency test and correction of shading were employed to increase the overall registration performance. The proposed hierarchical method for elastic registration was tested on an experimental database of 2D images of histochemically differently stained serial cross-sections of human skeletal muscle. The obtained results show that 95% of the images could be successfully registered. The inclusion of prior information is an important break through that may enable routine use of the mutual information cost function in a variety of 2D and 3D image registration algorithms in the future.

The philosophy and motivation underlying non-rigid registration is discussed and a guide to common terminology is presented. The core components of registration systems are described and outstanding issues of validity and validation are confronted. }

abstract={Objective methods for assessing perceptual image quality traditionally attempted to quantify the visibility of errors (differences) between a distorted image and a reference image using a variety of known properties of the human visual system. Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a structural similarity index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000. A MATLAB implementation of the proposed algorithm is available online at http://www.cns.nyu.edu/∼lcv/ssim/.},

The capability can be used to superimpose registered medical images such as those from \{CT\} or \{MRI\} on to a video image of a patient's body. Real-time object registration enables an image to be overlaid consistently on the objects even while the objects and cameras viewing it are moving. Object registration is composed of feature tracking, feature correspondence, and pose calculation of objects. This technique is based on geometric models of objects, but it can be extended so that some image overlay is possible without a prior model of the object. "

abstract ={Motivation: Tiled serial section Transmission Electron Microscopy (ssTEM) is increasingly used to describe high-resolution anatomy of large biological specimens. In particular in neurobiology, TEM is indispensable for analysis of synaptic connectivity in the brain. Registration of ssTEM image mosaics has to recover the 3D continuity and geometrical properties of the specimen in presence of various distortions that are applied to the tissue during sectioning, staining and imaging. These include staining artifacts, mechanical deformation, missing sections and the fact that structures may appear dissimilar in consecutive sections.Results: We developed a fully automatic, non-rigid but as-rigid-as-possible registration method for large tiled serial section microscopy stacks. We use the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to identify corresponding landmarks within and across sections and globally optimize the pose of all tiles in terms of least square displacement of these landmark correspondences. We evaluate the precision of the approach using an artificially generated dataset designed to mimic the properties of TEM data. We demonstrate the performance of our method by registering an ssTEM dataset of the first instar larval brain of Drosophila melanogaster consisting of 6885 images.Availability: This method is implemented as part of the open source software TrakEM2 (http://www.ini.uzh.ch/∼acardona/trakem2.html) and distributed through the Fiji project (http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de).Contact: tomancak@mpi-cbg.de},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose three novel and important methods for the registration of histological images for 3D reconstruction. First, possible intensity variations and nonstandardness in images are corrected by an intensity standardization process which maps the image scale into a standard scale where the similar intensities correspond to similar tissues meaning. Second, 2D histological images are mapped into a feature space where continuous variables are used as high confidence image features for accurate registration. Third, we propose an automatic best reference slice selection algorithm that improves reconstruction quality based on both image entropy and mean square error of the registration process. We demonstrate that the choice of reference slice has a significant impact on registration error, standardization, feature space and entropy information. After 2D histological slices are registered through an affine transformation with respect to an automatically chosen reference, the 3D volume is reconstructed by co-registering 2D slices elastically.},

abstract={EMPIRE10 (Evaluation of Methods for Pulmonary Image REgistration 2010) is a public platform for fair and meaningful comparison of registration algorithms which are applied to a database of intra patient thoracic CT image pairs. Evaluation of nonrigid registration techniques is a nontrivial task. This is compounded by the fact that researchers typically test only on their own data, which varies widely. For this reason, reliable assessment and comparison of different registration algorithms has been virtually impossible in the past. In this work we present the results of the launch phase of EMPIRE10, which comprised the comprehensive evaluation and comparison of 20 individual algorithms from leading academic and industrial research groups. All algorithms are applied to the same set of 30 thoracic CT pairs. Algorithm settings and parameters are chosen by researchers expert in the con figuration of their own method and the evaluation is independent, using the same criteria for all participants. All results are published on the EMPIRE10 website (http://empire10.isi.uu.nl). The challenge remains ongoing and open to new participants. Full results from 24 algorithms have been published at the time of writing. This paper details the organization of the challenge, the data and evaluation methods and the outcome of the initial launch with 20 algorithms. The gain in knowledge and future work are discussed.},

abstract={Deformable image registration is a fundamental task in medical image processing. Among its most important applications, one may cite: 1) multi-modality fusion, where information acquired by different imaging devices or protocols is fused to facilitate diagnosis and treatment planning; 2) longitudinal studies, where temporal structural or anatomical changes are investigated; and 3) population modeling and statistical atlases used to study normal anatomical variability. In this paper, we attempt to give an overview of deformable registration methods, putting emphasis on the most recent advances in the domain. Additional emphasis has been given to techniques applied to medical images. In order to study image registration methods in depth, their main components are identified and studied independently. The most recent techniques are presented in a systematic fashion. The contribution of this paper is to provide an extensive account of registration techniques in a systematic manner.},

    abstract = {<p>Structural abnormalities of the microvasculature can impair perfusion and function. Conventional histology provides good spatial resolution with which to evaluate the microvascular structure but affords no 3-dimensional information; this limitation could lead to misinterpretations of the complex microvessel network in health and disease. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate an accurate, fully automated 3D histology reconstruction method to visualize the arterioles and venules within the mouse hind-limb. Sections of the tibialis anterior muscle from C57BL/J6 mice (both normal and subjected to femoral artery excision) were reconstructed using pairwise rigid and affine registrations of 5 µm-thick, paraffin-embedded serial sections digitized at 0.25 µm/pixel. Low-resolution intensity-based rigid registration was used to initialize the nucleus landmark-based registration, and conventional high-resolution intensity-based registration method. The affine nucleus landmark-based registration was developed in this work and was compared to the conventional affine high-resolution intensity-based registration method. Target registration errors were measured between adjacent tissue sections (pairwise error), as well as with respect to a 3D reference reconstruction (accumulated error, to capture propagation of error through the stack of sections). Accumulated error measures were lower (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) for the nucleus landmark technique and superior vasculature continuity was observed. These findings indicate that registration based on automatic extraction and correspondence of small, homologous landmarks may support accurate 3D histology reconstruction. This technique avoids the otherwise problematic “banana-into-cylinder” effect observed using conventional methods that optimize the pairwise alignment of salient structures, forcing them to be section-orthogonal. This approach will provide a valuable tool for high-accuracy 3D histology tissue reconstructions for analysis of diseased microvasculature.</p>},

The system is designed to allow an arbitrary number of applications to communicate in a peer-to-peer manner. An application may offer services to clients in the network which can access it over the Internet. For service-discovery, the supporting runtime-system (implemented itself in Haskell) can map symbolic names to the low-level references used for internal communication. A stream layer abstracts from the actual IO and allows to use some means of communication in a functional context. We present both our experiences from the implementation and sample applications, using many of the language features Haskell provides. Finally a detailed discussion of the implementation is provided.},

	are based on the same host sequential implementation --- the high
	performance Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), and both implementations
	are available on the same distributed architecture --- the St Andrews
	Beowulf cluster. This allows an exceptionally pure comparison of
	the language design characteristics and their impact on parallel
	performance.
	
	The comparison is illustrated by two parallel benchmarks which expose
	differences in the communication, process creation, and work distribution
	mechanisms employed by Eden and GpH. Our results show that the explicit
	process model favoured by Eden gives good parallel performance for
	coarse-grained applications running on the Beowulf cluster. In comparison,
	the implicit process model used in GpH gives poorer absolute speedup
	for this class of application on this architecture. Further work
	is needed to verify the reasons for this difference in performance
	and to extend these results to other architectures."},

  abstract = {The parallel functional language Eden extends Haskell with expressions
	to define and instantiate process systems. These extensions allow
	also the easy definition of skeletons as higher-order functions.
	Parallel programming is possible in Eden at two levels: Recursive
	programming and higher-order programming. At the lower level, processes
	are explicitly created by using recursive definitions. In this way,
	skeletons can be defined. This is very unusual, as most skeleton-based
	languages use an imperative language to create new skeletons. At
	the higher level, available skeletons are used to create applications
	or to define new skeletons on top of the other ones. In this paper,
	we present five skeletons, most of them well-known, covering a wide
	range of parallel structures. For each one, several Eden implementations
	are given, together with their corresponding cost models. Finally,
	some examples of application programming are shown, including predicted
	and actual results on a Beowulf cluster.},

                  of polynomial ideals without relying on term
                  orders. The main ingredient is a homogeneous
                  reduction algorithm which orthogonalizes leading
                  terms instead of completely canceling them. This
                  allows for an extension of Buchberger's algorithm to
                  construct these H-bases algorithmically. In
                  addition, the close connection of this approach to
                  minimal degree interpolation, and in particular to
                  the least interpolation scheme due to de Boor and
                  Ron, is pointed out.},

The purpose of the system is to support the algorithmic construction of programs at compile-time. The ability to generate code at compile time allows the programmer to implement such features as polytypic programs, macro-like expansion, user directed optimization (such as inlining), and the generation of supporting data structures and functions from existing data structures and functions. Our design is being implemented in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, ghc. [doi.acm.org/10.1145/581690.581691 (paper)][10/'02] www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1581136056/fourwheeldriveinA/ .},

The two collaborated closely during the 1650s on some original and unusual mathematics, but while Wallis acquired a lasting reputation, Brouncker's work is no longer well known. The two parts of this paper analyse the joint work of Wallis and Brouncker and attempt to separate their respective contributions and very different mathematical styles. The main subject of Part I is Brouncker's discovery of continued fractions. He gave few clues as to how he obtained his results and I offer a possible reconstruction of his work. His quadrature of the hyperbola and rectification of the semicubical parabola are also discussed. Brouncker emerges as a skilled and intuitive mathematician.},

                  widespread use of parallel processing by both
                  industry and software houses. The two key issues of
                  portability of code and of generality of parallel
                  architectures are discussed. An overview of useful
                  computational models and programming paradigms for
                  parallel machines is presented along with some
                  detailed case studies implemented on transputer
                  arrays. Valiant's results on optimally universal
                  parallel machines are reviewed along with the
                  prospects of building truly general-purpose parallel
                  computers. Some remarks on language and software
                  tool developments for parallel programming form the
                  conclusion to the paper.},

                  that are superior to both the classical and
                  Strassen's algorithm for moderate n (starting with n
                  = 20). The Bini-Lotti result on the weak stability
                  of bilinear algorithms applies to these
                  algorithms. We present them in two equivalent
                  versions, bilinear and trilinear. We also apply one
                  of these algorithms over finite fields (or rings) of
                  constants. Surprisingly, this enables us to decrease
                  the bilinear complexity of n X n matrix
                  multiplication (for 20 <= n <= 10^20) below the
                  current record upper bound for the same computation

  abstract            = {Locally weighted regression, or loess, is a way of
                  estimating a regression surface through a
                  multivariate smoothing procedure, fitting a function
                  of the independent variables locally and in a moving
                  fashion analogous to how a moving average is
                  computed for a time series. With local fitting we
                  can estimate a much wider class of regression
                  surfaces than with the usual classes of parametric
                  functions, such as polynomials. The goal of this
                  article is to show, through applications, how loess
                  can be used for three purposes: data exploration,
                  diagnostic checking of parametric models, and
                  providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along
                  the way, the following methodology is introduced:
                  (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an
                  extension of univariate locally weighted regression;
                  (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to
                  those used in the least-squares fitting of
                  parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods
                  that are useful tools for understanding loess
                  estimates and checking the assumptions on which the
                  estimation procedure is based; and (d) the M plot,
                  an adaptation of Mallow's C<sub>p</sub> procedure,
                  which provides a graphical portrayal of the
                  trade-off between variance and bias, and which can
                  be used to choose the amount of smoothing.},

                  small if it is not. A robust fitting procedure is
                  used that guards against deviant points distorting
                  the smoothed points. Visual, computational, and
                  statistical issues of robust locally weighted
                  regression are discussed. Several examples,
                  including data on lead intoxication, are used to
                  illustrate the methodology.},

                  large and complex systems. This connection to
                  statistical mechanics exposes new information and

abstract = {We present a new method to measure specular free-form surfaces within seconds. We call the measuring principle `Phase Measuring Deflectometry' (PMD). With a stereo based enhancement of PMD we are able to measure both the height and the slope of the surface.  The basic principle is to project sinusoidal fringe patterns onto a screen located remotely from the surface under test and to observe the fringe patterns reflected via the surface. Any slope variations of the surface lead to distortions of the patterns. Using well-known phase-shift algorithms, we can precisely measure these distortions and thus calculate the surface normal in each pixel. We will deduce the method's diffraction-theoretical limits and explain how to reach them. A major challenge is the necessary calibration. We solved this task by combining various photogrammetric methods. We reach a repeatability of the local slope down to a few arc seconds and an absolute accuracy of a few arc minutes. One important field of application is the measurement of the local curvature of progressive eyeglass lenses. We will present experimental results and compare these results with the theoretical limits.},

We therefore performed a 3D reconstruction of 150 serial sections of a representative adult human spleen alternately stained for CD3 and CD20. The results indicate that the T-cell regions of human spleens may be interrupted by B-cell follicles. Therefore, there is no continuous periarteriolar lymphatic T-cell sheath (PALS) around white pulp arterioles. An arteriole may be surrounded by T-lymphocytes at one level, then run across a follicle without any T-cells around, and finally re-enter a T-cell region. T- and B-cell compartments are intricately interdigitated in the human splenic white pulp. CD4+ T-lymphocytes and the typical fibroblasts of the T-cell region may extend as a thin shell at the follicular surface within the marginal zone. On the other hand, IgD++ B-cells continue from the follicular outer marginal zone along the surface of the T-cell region. Our findings indicate that the microanatomy of the splenic white pulp differs between humans and rodents. This may have consequences for the immigration of recirculating lymphocytes and for initial interactions among antigen-specific T- and B-lymphocytes.},

There is, consequently, widespread interest in accurately relating information in the different images for diagnosis, treatment and basic science. This article reviews registration techniques used to solve this problem, and describes the wide variety of applications to which these techniques are applied. Applications of image registration include combining images of the same subject from different modalities, aligning temporal sequences of images to compensate for motion of the subject between scans, image guidance during interventions and aligning images from multiple subjects in cohort studies. Current registration algorithms can, in many cases, automatically register images that are related by a rigid body transformation (i.e. where tissue deformation can be ignored). There has also been substantial progress in non-rigid registration algorithms that can compensate for tissue deformation, or align images from different subjects. Nevertheless many registration problems remain unsolved, and this is likely to continue to be an active field of research in the future.},

  abstract  = {Image registration plays an increasingly important role in the field of medical image processing given the plurality
of images often acquired from different sensors, time points, or viewpoints. Landmark-based registration schemes
represent the most popular class of registration methods due to their simplicity and high accuracy. Previous
studies have shown that these registration schemes are sensitive to the number and location of landmarks.
Identifying important landmarks to perform an accurate registration remains a very challenging task. Current
landmark selection methods, such as feature-based approaches, focus on optimization of global transformation
and may have poor performance in recovering local deformation, e.g. subtle tissue changes caused by tumor
resection, making them inappropriate for registering pre- and post-surgery images as a small cancerous region
will be deformed after removing a tumor. In this work, a novel method is introduced to estimate optimal landmark
configurations. An important landmark configuration that will be used as a training landmark set was learned
for an image pair with a known deformation. This landmark configuration can be considered as a collection
of discrete points. A generic transformation matrix between a pair of training landmark sets with different
deformation locations was computed via an iterative close point (ICP) alignment technique. A new landmark
configuration was determined by simply transforming the training landmarks to the current displacement location
while preserving the topological structure of the configuration of landmarks. Two assumptions are made: 1) In
a new pair of images the deformation is approximately the same size and has only been spatially relocated in the
image, and that by a simple affine transformation one can identify the optimal configuration on this new pair of
images; and 2) The deformation is of similar size and shape on the original pair of images. These are reasonable
assumptions in many cases where one seeks to register tumor images at multiple time points following application
of therapy and to evaluate changes in tumor size. The experiments were conducted on 286 pairs of synthetic
MRI brain images. The training landmark configurations were obtained through 2000 iterations of registration
where the points with consistently best registration performance were selected. The estimated landmarks greatly
improved the quality metrics compared to a uniform grid placement scheme and a speeded-up robust features
(SURF) based method as well as a generic free-form deformation (FFD) approach. The quantitative results
showed that the new landmark configuration achieved 95\% improvement in recovering the local deformation
compared to 89\% for the uniform grid placement, 79\% for the SURF-based approach, and 10\% for the generic
FFD approach.

  abstract   = {In this paper, we propose three novel and important methods for the registration of histological images for 3D reconstruction. First, possible intensity variations and nonstandardness in images are corrected by an intensity standardization process which maps the image scale into a standard scale where the similar intensities correspond to similar tissues meaning. Second, 2D histological images are mapped into a feature space where continuous variables are used as high confidence image features for accurate registration. Third, we propose an automatic best reference slice selection algorithm that improves reconstruction quality based on both image entropy and mean square error of the registration process. We demonstrate that the choice of reference slice has a significant impact on registration error, standardization, feature space and entropy information. After 2D histological slices are registered through an affine transformation with respect to an automatically chosen reference, the 3D volume is reconstructed by co-registering 2D slices elastically.},

  abstract   = {We present a super-fast and parameter-free algorithm for non-rigid elastic registration of images of a serially sectioned whole rat brain. The purpose is to produce a three-dimensional high-resolution reconstruction. The registration is modelled as a minimization problem of a functional consisting of a distance measure and a regularizer based on the elastic potential of the displacement field. The minimization of the functional leads to a system of non-linear partial differential equations, the so-called Navier-Lame equations (NLE). Discretization of the NLE and a fixed point type iteration method lead to a linear system of equations, which has to be solved at each iteration step. We not only present a super-fast solution technique for this system, but also come up with sound strategies for accelerating the outer iteration. This does include a multi-scale approach based on a Gaussian pyramid as well as a clever estimation of the material constants for the elastic potential. The results of the registration process were controlled by an expert who was able to recognize histological details like laminations which was not possible before. Therefore, it is essential to apply elastic registration to this kind of imaging problem. Finally, the visually pleasing results were quantified by a distance measure leading to an improvement of about 79% after just 35 iteration steps.},

  abstract  = {In image registration of medical data a common and challenging problem is handling intensity-inhomogeneities. These  inhomogeneities appear for instance in images of serially sectioned brains caused by the histological staining process or in medical imaging with contrast agents. Beneath this, natural outliers (for instance cells or vessels) produced by the underlying material itself may be mistaken as noise. Both image registration applications have in common that the well known sum of squared differences (SSD) measure would detect false differences. To deal with these kinds of problems, we supplement the common SSD-measure with image derivatives of higher order. Additionally we introduce a non-quadratic penalizer function to the distance measure leading to robust energy. The concepts are well known in optical flow. Overall, we present a variational model which combines all of these properties. This formulation leads to a fast and efficient algorithm. We demonstrate its applicability at the problems described above.},

abstract = "This article tackles the registration of 2-D biomedical images (histological sections, autoradiographs, cryosections, etc.). Our goal is to adequately match anatomical features of interest without inducing biologically improbable tissue distortions. We observe that the large variety of registration applications – 3-D volume reconstruction, multimodal molecular mapping, etc. – induce a no less diverse set of requirements in terms of accuracy and robustness. In turn, these directly translate into regularization constraints on the deformation model, which should ideally be specifiable by the user. We propose an adaptive regularization approach where the rigidity constraints are informed by the registration application at hand and whose support is controlled by the geometry of the images to be registered. For each site of a sparse lattice over which a displacement field has been computed, our algorithm estimates, in a robust fashion, a rigid or affine transformation within a circular neighbourhood cut to fit the local geometry around the site. We investigate the behaviour of this technique and discuss its sensitivity to the rigidity parameter. "

Grace (Graph-based communication in Eden) allows the programmer to specify a network of processes as a graph, where the graph nodes represent processes and the edges represent communication channels. This simplifies the specification and creation of complex communication topologies. The main benefit of the Grace approach is the clean separation between coordination and computation. A special problem is the maintenance of type-safety. Runtime experiments show that Grace has a marginal overhead in comparison with traditional Eden code.",

abstract="We demonstrate approaches to the static parallelization of loops and recursions on the example of the polynomial product. Phrased as a loop nest, the polynomial product can be parallelized automatically by applying a space-time mapping technique based on linear algebra and linear programming. One can choose a parallel program that is optimal with respect to some objective function like the number of execution steps, processors, channels, etc. However,at best,linear execution time complexity can be atained. Through phrasing the polynomial product as a divide-and-conquer recursion, one can obtain a parallel program with sublinear execution time. In this case, the target program is not derived by an automatic search but given as a program skeleton, which can be deduced by a sequence of equational program transformations. We discuss the use of such skeletons, compare and assess the models in which loops and divide-and-conquer resursions are parallelized and comment on the performance properties of the resulting parallel implementations.",

abstract = "Monads have become very popular for structuring functional programs since Wadler introduced their use in 1990. In particular, libraries of combinators are often based on a monadic type. Such libraries share (in part) a common interface, from which numerous benefits flow, such as the possibility to write generic code which works together with any library. But, several interesting and useful libraries are fundamentally incompatible with the monadic interface. In this paper I propose a generalisation of monads, which I call arrows, with significantly wider applicability. The paper shows how many of the techniques of monadic programming generalise to the new setting, and gives examples to show that the greater generality is useful. In particular, three non-monadic libraries for efficient parsing, building graphical user interfaces, and programming active web pages fit naturally into the new framework."

It has long been folklore that Arrows, a functional programming construct, and Freyd categories, a categorical notion due to Power, Robinson and Thielecke, are somehow equivalent. In this paper, we show that the situation is more subtle. By considering Arrows wholly within the base category we derive two alternative formulations of Freyd category that are equivalent to Arrows‚Äîenriched Freyd categories and indexed Freyd categories. By imposing a further condition, we characterise those indexed Freyd categories that are isomorphic to Freyd categories. The key differentiating point is the number of inputs available to a computation and the structure available on them, where structured input is modelled using comonads."

abstract="Today, parallel programming is dominated by message passing libraries such as MPI. Algorithmic skeletons intend to simplify parallel programming by increasing the expressive power. The idea is to offer typical parallel programming patterns as polymorphic higher-order functions which are efficiently implemented in parallel. The approach presented here integrates the main features of existing skeleton systems. Moreover, it does not come along with a new programming language or language extension, which parallel programmers may hesitate to learn, but it is offered in form of a library, which can easily be used by e.g. C and C++ programmers. A major technical difficulty is to simulate the main requirements for a skeleton implementation, namely higher-order functions, partial applications, and polymorphism as efficiently as possible in an imperative programming language. Experimental results based on a draft implementation of the suggested skeleton library show that this can be achieved without a significant performance penalty.",

The solution of a tridiagonal system of equations is considered as our case study. We describe how this application can be developed using the double-scan and report experimental results for both absolute performance and performance predictability of the skeleton-based solution.",

	abstract = {Profunctor optics are a neat and composable representation of bidirectional data accessors, including lenses, and their dual, prisms. The profunctor representation exploits higher-order functions and higher-kinded type constructor classes, but the relationship between this and the familiar representation in terms of "getter" and "setter" functions is not at all obvious. We derive the profunctor representation from the concrete representation, making the relationship clear. It turns out to be a fairly direct application of the Yoneda Lemma, arguably the most important result in category theory. We hope this derivation aids understanding of the profunctor representation. Conversely, it might also serve to provide some insight into the Yoneda Lemma.},
