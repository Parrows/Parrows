\section{Topology Skeletons}
Even though many algorithms can be expressed by parallel maps, some problems require more sophisticated skeletons. The Eden library leverages this problem and already comes with a \textit{ring} and a \textit{torus} implementation \cite{eden_cefp, eden_skel_topology}. These two seem like reasonable candidates to be ported to our arrow based parallel Haskell to prove that its feasibility.
