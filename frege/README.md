# Simple Apache Maven based Frege Example

This project is a simple [Frege](http://www.frege-lang.org/) based project using
the Apache Maven project.

The `pom.xml` is configured to use the [frege-maven-plugin](https://github.com/talios/frege-maven-plugin) via
the newly released [frege-maven-tile](https://github.com/talios/frege-maven-tile) for ease of configuration.

This project contains some very simple Java/Frege interop and can serve as a quick start to experimenting with Frege.
